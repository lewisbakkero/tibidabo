[In a previous entry](https://lewisbakkero.github.io/tibidabo/audios/Consensus.mp3), we explored the basics of blockchain consensus. Now, let's delve into the technical nuances of some popular consensus mechanisms.

One of the most significant differences between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) lies in their energy consumption. PoW, used by Bitcoin, is computationally intensive, leading to high electricity costs. PoS, using a staking mechanism, drastically reduces energy consumption.

Scalability is another key differentiator. PoW systems often struggle to handle a large volume of transactions. PoS and its variants, like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), allow for faster transaction processing.

Decentralization, the distribution of power, also varies significantly. PoW aims for decentralization but can lead to centralization through mining pools. PoS offers broader participation but large stakeholders can exert significant influence. DPoS further centralizes power by electing delegates.

Let's summarize these differences and add more details in a table:

| Consensus Protocol          | Agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Validity                                                                                                                                                         | Termination                                                                                                                                                           | Fault Tolerance                                                                                                                                                                                   | Scalability                                                                                                                                                                                          | Decentralization                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Proof of Work (PoW)**     | Achieves agreement through competitive mining, where miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to propose new blocks. The first to solve it gets to add the block, creating a competitive environment.                     | Validity is maintained as only valid blocks that adhere to network rules can be added; thus, all transactions included must be legitimate.                     | Termination occurs when a block is successfully mined and added to the chain, but finality can be uncertain due to potential forks in the blockchain.                                          | Can tolerate up to 51% of nodes being compromised; however, it is vulnerable to attacks if a single entity gains majority control.                                                                       | Limited scalability due to high computational requirements and energy consumption; transaction throughput decreases with increased network load.                                                        | Promotes decentralization by allowing anyone with computing power to participate in mining, but can lead to centralization over time due to mining pools.                                                  |
| **Proof of Stake (PoS)**    | Achieves agreement by selecting validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold; those with higher stakes have a better chance of being chosen to propose new blocks.                                         | Validity is ensured since only staked cryptocurrencies can be used for block proposals, aligning validators' interests with the network's integrity.         | Termination is efficient as blocks are quickly finalized once a supermajority of validators agree on a proposal, leading to faster transaction confirmations.                                   | Can tolerate failures similar to PoW but depends on the distribution of stakes; collusion among large stakeholders could disrupt consensus but generally remains resilient against random failures. | Scales well compared to PoW since it does not require intensive computations for block creation; transaction throughput increases with more validators without significant overhead.                     | Allows for greater decentralization than PoW since anyone can participate without needing expensive hardware; however, large stakeholders may exert disproportionate influence over consensus decisions. |
| **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** | Achieves agreement through an election process where stakeholders vote for delegates who validate transactions and create blocks on their behalf, enhancing efficiency in decision-making.                               | Validity is maintained as only elected delegates can propose blocks; this mechanism ensures that all transactions processed are legitimate according to network rules. | Termination occurs quickly due to the limited number of delegates involved in block production; decisions are made rapidly based on delegate votes.                                               | Can handle failures effectively depending on how many delegates are elected; if some delegates fail or act maliciously, others can continue validating transactions.                                      | Scales well because fewer nodes (delegates) are involved in block production, leading to faster transaction processing times compared to traditional PoW or PoS systems.                                  | Tends toward centralization because a small number of delegates hold significant power over consensus decisions; this can lead to governance challenges within the network structure.                       |
| **Proof of Authority (PoA)** | Achieves agreement by designating trusted authorities responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks, relying on their reputation rather than resource-intensive processes.                               | Validity is ensured because only pre-approved authorities can propose new blocks, which reduces the risk of invalid transactions being included in the blockchain. | Termination is achieved quickly since trusted authorities produce blocks at regular intervals without needing extensive consensus processes among all participants.                                    | Limited fault tolerance since if too many authorities become unavailable or act maliciously, it could compromise system integrity; however, it generally functions well under normal conditions.        | Scales very well due to its lightweight nature; fewer nodes involved in validation means faster transaction processing and lower resource consumption compared to other methods.                              | Has low decentralization because it relies on a fixed set of trusted authorities; this may simplify governance but raises concerns about central control and trustworthiness.                               |

If a transaction remains unconfirmed for an extended period, users or wallet software may choose to rebroadcast it. Several third-party services offer tools to resubmit raw, signed transactions to the network, often referred to as "pushtx" services.
